# AuthenticationWithFirebase
 This app was made to practice the sign in and sign up options for an app using Firebase

## What does the app do?
It just lets you sign up or sign in using a basic provider or google as a provider. It does this through Firebase.

When you sign up or sign in, the apps takes you to a simple screen where you can see your email and the provider (basic or google).

If you don't log out, the app keeps you signed in when you close the app.

### Simple and small app
This was made to practice sign in, sign up and sign out through Firebase and was my first time doing an mobile app and using swift.

### Pods
This project uses cocoapods, therefore it is better to have them installed. I added them on the repository so maybe this shouldn't make any trouble.
